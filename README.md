## Onion Architecture In ASP.NET Core With Domain Driven Design and Angular as Frontend

The onion architecture, overcomes the issues of the layered architecture with great ease. With Onion Architecture, the game changer is that the Domain Layer (Entities and Validation Rules that are common to the business case ) is at the Core of the Entire Application. This means higher flexbility and lesser coupling. In this approach, we can see that all the Layers are dependent only on the Core Layers.
